# Guideline authoring, clinical review, and publication workflow

This runbook describes the supported dashboard workflow from creating a
guideline to publishing a reviewed version. It is intended for authors,
clinical reviewers, publishers, and administrators.

The central safety rule is that the Markdown source, generated reader content,
clinical review, and publication are separate steps. Saving or assigning a
reviewer does not approve clinical content, and regeneration never publishes a
version automatically.

## Roles and separation of duties

| Responsibility | Typical permission | What it permits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read a private draft | `guideline.markdown.read` | View Markdown revisions and private previews. |
| Author Markdown | `guideline.markdown.edit` | Save drafts and checkpoints. |
| Upload source files | `guideline.markdown.upload` | Upload PDF or Markdown source documents. |
| Manage images | `guideline.asset.manage` | Upload and manage version-scoped image assets. |
| Regenerate reader content | `guideline.structure.regenerate` | Start, retry, or cancel structured-content generation. |
| Participate in review | `guideline.review` | Read review workspaces, assignments, comments, and activity. |
| Approve clinical blocks | `guideline.high_risk.approve` | Approve or reject high-risk tables and clinical blocks and accept regeneration. |
| Publish | `guideline.publish` | Publish a version that has passed every gate. |

Authors should not be granted high-risk approval merely to clear their own
warnings. Use an independently authorized clinical reviewer whenever the
organization's governance policy requires separation of duties. The backend
uses the authenticated user's identity for every decision and audit event.

## State and artifact model

A guideline document can have multiple versions. Each editable version can
have multiple immutable Markdown revisions. The important artifacts are:

- **Markdown revision:** the exact authored source and its validation report;
- **structured content:** generated sections, blocks, search chunks, and
  embeddings for one exact Markdown revision;
- **block decisions:** `draft`, `reviewed`, or `rejected` decisions on generated
  blocks;
- **regeneration review:** acceptance or rejection of the complete generated
  result;
- **published version:** the immutable public projection used by web, mobile,
  search, offline packages, and RAG.

Saving a newer Markdown revision makes older generated content outdated. Any
edit to an already reviewed structured block resets that block to `draft`.

## Complete workflow

### 1. Create the guideline document

1. Sign in to the dashboard with authoring access.
2. Open **Clinical Guidelines** > **Create Guideline**.
3. Enter the title, program area, country, source organization, language, and
   other required metadata.
4. Save the document.

Metadata describes the whole guideline. Do not put a version-specific clinical
review decision in document-level metadata.

### 2. Create a version

1. Open the guideline detail page.
2. Select **New Version**.
3. Enter the version label, publication date, review date, and other requested
   version metadata.
4. Save the version.

Published versions are immutable. Create a new draft version when updating a
published guideline.

### 3. Add the source

Choose one supported path:

- select **Upload PDF** for an authoritative PDF that must be extracted;
- open **Author Markdown** and use **Load Markdown** for an existing `.md` or
  `.markdown` file;
- start with blank Markdown or **Start from template**;
- duplicate a draft or create a draft from an existing published revision.

PDF upload preserves the original document as the fidelity reference.
Markdown-only guidelines can complete the publication workflow but cannot
claim PDF page citations.

### 4. Edit and validate Markdown

1. Open **Edit Markdown**.
2. Use **Edit**, **Split**, or **Preview** mode.
3. Resolve all red validation errors. Warnings may require either a source
   correction or later clinical review.
4. Select **Save** to create the next immutable server revision.
5. Optionally select **Checkpoint** and provide a name and change summary before
   a substantial edit.

Useful preview presentations include rendered Markdown, public reader,
structured reader, mobile reader, search results, and RAG chunks. These are
private previews and do not publish the guideline.

For tables:

- keep the same number of cells in the header, separator, and every row;
- retain empty-cell delimiters;
- verify values, units, headings, footnotes, and sources against the approved
  document;
- use the visual table editor for structural changes, but never change a
  clinical value merely to silence a warning.

#### Standard chapter hierarchy

Use one H1 document title, H2 for chapters or front matter, and progressively
nested headings for content inside each chapter:

```markdown
# Guideline title

## Introduction or front matter

## Chapter 1: Chapter title

### Major section

#### Subsection
```

Do not skip heading levels. The structured extractor retains this hierarchy as
section parent-child relationships. In the mobile chapter browser, a single H1
is treated as the document wrapper and its H2 children become chapter cards.
Curated legacy publications whose chapters are already roots remain supported.

Templates provide structure only. Replace the template title and every
`_Add reviewed clinical content._` marker before regeneration. Unchanged
template headings, placeholder bodies, multiple document roots, title
mismatches, and skipped levels block publication.

### 5. Assign reviewers and collaborate

1. In the Markdown editor, select **Review & activity**.
2. Under **Reviewer assignments**, choose an active clinical reviewer by name.
3. Add an optional due date and select **Assign reviewer**.
4. Use revision comments to record questions or requested changes.
5. Resolve or reopen comments as work progresses.

Assignment coordinates responsibility only. Neither **Assign reviewer** nor
**Complete** changes a clinical block to `reviewed`.

If the reviewer list is empty, an administrator must activate the account and
grant a role containing `guideline.review`. High-risk approval also requires
`guideline.high_risk.approve`.

### 6. Regenerate structured content

1. Save the intended Markdown revision.
2. Confirm that authoritative Markdown validation has no blocking errors.
3. Select **Regenerate structured content** from the editor toolbar.
4. Monitor the real job status until generation completes or reports
   `review_required`.

Regeneration is bound to one immutable revision. Do not continue review if a
newer revision has made the job stale. Retry a failed job only after resolving
the reported storage, worker, parsing, or validation problem.

### 7. Review generated sections and blocks

1. Return to the guideline detail page.
2. On the draft version, select **Editorial Review**.
3. Select a section in the structure panel.
4. Select each generated block under **Blocks**.
5. Compare the rendered block and typed payload with the original PDF or other
   approved source.
6. Correct extraction mistakes with **Save correction**. Saving a correction
   resets the decision to `draft`, so review the corrected result again.
7. Select **Approve** when the block is faithful and clinically correct, or
   **Reject** when it must not be published.

The badge beside a successfully approved block changes from `draft` to
`reviewed`. The authenticated reviewer and decision time are recorded in the
audit trail.

#### Marking a table reviewed

For every table warning:

1. Open **Editorial Review** for the same guideline version.
2. In **Blocks**, locate the block labelled **table**. The card shows the table
   title or its section name.
3. Select the table and compare every column heading, row, value, unit,
   footnote, caption, and source with the authoritative source.
4. If anything is wrong, correct the Markdown, save, regenerate, and return to
   review. Use **Save correction** only for an intentional structured-content
   correction.
5. If the generated table is correct, select **Approve**.
6. Confirm that its badge reads `reviewed`.
7. Repeat for every table. There is no bulk clinical-table approval because
   each decision must be deliberate and auditable.

The warning `high_risk_table_review_required` does not mean the Markdown table
is malformed. It means a valid clinical table will become public only after an
authorized reviewer explicitly approves its generated block.

### 8. Review figures and other high-risk content

Repeat the source comparison and approval process for clinically sensitive
figures and for recommendations, warnings, cautions, contraindications,
dosages, procedures, referrals, key points, and algorithms. A figure cannot be
published while its referenced asset remains unreviewed.

Ordinary prose may still require editorial checking even when it is not a
high-risk publication blocker.

### 9. Accept the regeneration

After individual review decisions and comment resolution, return to the
Markdown editor, inspect the regeneration comparison, and select **Accept
regenerated projection**. Use **Reject and return to Markdown** when the
projection is not faithful. Overall acceptance is refused while any required
high-risk block is still `draft` or `rejected`.

The regeneration panel shows the authoritative outstanding-block count and a
sample of the pending block types and source pages. When the count is nonzero:

1. Select **Review pending blocks**.
2. The Editorial Review workspace opens the first pending high-risk block.
3. The block list defaults to **Pending high-risk only**. Choose **High-risk
   only** to include approved safety-sensitive blocks, or **All blocks** when
   ordinary surrounding content is needed for context or correction.
4. Compare it with the original source and select **Approve**, or correct and
   re-review it. The queue advances to the next pending block after approval.
5. A rejected block is intentionally still pending. Correct its source or typed
   payload, regenerate when the source changed, and approve the corrected block.
6. When the queue reports that all high-risk blocks are approved, select
   **Return to regeneration review**.
7. Select **Refresh approval status**, then **Accept regenerated projection**.

There is no bulk-approval or force-accept action. Tables, dosages,
recommendations, warnings, cautions, contraindications, procedures, algorithms,
algorithm references, and referral criteria require an individual, auditable
clinical decision.

Acceptance applies to the exact generated revision. Saving or regenerating a
new revision requires a new review and acceptance cycle.

### 10. Validate publication

On the guideline detail page, select **Publish**. The dashboard first runs the
authoritative publication validator. It checks, among other things:

- the current Markdown revision matches the generated and accepted revision;
- Markdown and HTML/source assets exist;
- section hierarchy, ordering, levels, and slugs are valid;
- no authoring-template title or placeholder remains;
- the Markdown has exactly one H1 and an unbroken parent-child heading tree;
- the candidate has not unexpectedly lost more than half of the current
  publication's chapters, sections, blocks, tables, or high-risk blocks;
- typed block payloads and figure references are valid;
- all required high-risk blocks and assets are reviewed;
- meaningful chapter content includes reviewed prose rather than only tables;
- a partial projection has a reviewed original PDF or offline fallback;
- clinical leaf sections are not predominantly empty;
- reviewed coverage has not substantially regressed from the current version;
- the regeneration review is accepted.

If the toast says **Publication needs review**, return to **Editorial Review**.
The message now names the affected table or section where possible. Reviewer
assignment by itself cannot satisfy this gate.

### 11. Publish and verify

When validation succeeds:

1. Select **Publish** and confirm success.
2. Verify the version is the document's current published version.
3. Open the public guidelines platform and search for the title and key terms.
4. Verify representative sections, tables, figures, and internal links on web
   and mobile widths.
5. Verify the mobile reader and offline package after synchronization.
6. Verify RAG citations resolve to the published version and source context.

The previously published version remains public while a replacement is being
edited and reviewed. A failed draft must not displace it.

### Repairing an accidentally published template

Do not edit the published version in place. Create a new version from the last
complete published revision or the authoritative source, give it a newer
version number, regenerate, review, accept, and publish it. Publishing the
replacement updates the document's current version while retaining the bad
version in immutable history for audit. Confirm the public manifest, chapter
cards, representative clinical blocks, search results, and RAG citations after
the replacement becomes current.

## Partially reviewed publication audit

This audit records the empty-section failure reproduced from Diabetes
`2026.09.01` on 8 September 2026. The public manifest contained 16 reviewed
blocks and reported 15 sections containing reviewed content, while the public
hierarchy contained 310 structural sections. All 16 public blocks were tables;
there were no reviewed paragraphs. The clinical leaf section `1.1. Global
prevalence of diabetes` consequently had no public body content.

The failure is a workflow gap, not a chapter-parser defect:

1. Markdown regeneration in `ai-worker/app/repositories/guideline_repo.py`
   deletes the previous generated projection and creates every regenerated
   block and chunk as `draft`. This correctly avoids automatic clinical
   approval.
2. Sections are structural records without review status, so the complete
   outline remains visible while its blocks await decisions.
3. Regeneration acceptance requires individual decisions for high-risk blocks.
   Publication validation now also blocks a meaningful document with no
   reviewed prose, suspicious single-type review, or predominantly empty
   clinical leaves.
4. The public content service correctly exposes all current sections but only
   blocks marked `reviewed`.
5. Manifest schema 2 defines `section_count` as every active structural
   section and reports reviewed/leaf coverage separately through
   `reviewed_section_count`, `leaf_section_count`,
   `reviewed_leaf_section_count`, `empty_leaf_section_count`, `block_count`,
   and `reviewed_paragraph_count`.
6. Search and RAG use approved chunks from the current published version, so
   draft paragraph chunks remain unavailable. An absent original document or
   offline package then leaves no fallback for an empty section.

`TestPartialReviewPublicationRegression` is the executable regression test. Its
fixture contains one H1 wrapper, two H2 chapters, clinical H3 leaves, draft
paragraph/list content, one reviewed table, and no original PDF. It documents
that the validator rejects partial publication without a fallback, then reviews
the missing prose, publishes successfully, and verifies the corrected manifest
and public projection.

### Authoritative block-review policy

Block risk classification is defined once in
`backend/internal/models/guideline_block_review_policy.go`. Publication
validation and regeneration review use that policy directly, and the
authenticated Editorial Review workspace exposes it as `block_review_policy`
so the dashboard does not maintain a separate high-risk list.

- High risk and individually reviewed: tables, recommendations, warnings,
  cautions, contraindications, dosages, procedures, algorithms, algorithm
  references, and referral criteria.
- Low risk and eligible for a future controlled bulk operation: paragraphs,
  headings, ordered lists, unordered lists, references, and page breaks.
- Conditional: figures. The referenced asset determines clinical sensitivity,
  and figures are never bulk-review eligible.
- Ineligible for bulk review: unknown blocks and conservative clinical types
  not explicitly admitted to the low-risk allowlist, including key points,
  evidence, definitions, and clinical notes.
- Clinically sensitive assets always require an individual review decision.

Bulk APIs enforce the backend allowlist and never trust client classification.
They do not approve existing content automatically, mutate a published version,
or weaken existing clinical-safety gates.

### Manifest repair for an existing publication

Publishing regenerates manifest schema 2 automatically. To repair metadata for
an already-published version after deploying the migration, an administrator
with `guideline.publish` may call
`POST /api/v2/guideline-versions/{versionId}/regenerate-manifest`. The operation
does not change clinical content or the current version. It recalculates the
manifest, checksum, ETag, offline capabilities, and completeness counts, and
records `guideline.manifest.regenerated` in the audit log.

### Controlled low-risk bulk review

Editorial Review provides a paginated bulk-review queue for large guidelines.
Reviewers can filter by review state, risk, block type, and section; select
eligible blocks on the visible page or across the selected section; and approve
at most 500 blocks in one operation. Selection IDs remain stable while moving
between pages. High-risk, conditional, unknown, and otherwise ineligible blocks
never display bulk-selection controls.

Approval requires the reviewer to explicitly attest that every selected block
was checked against the authoritative source. The dashboard sends the exact
current Markdown revision and regeneration job identities to
`POST /api/v2/guideline-versions/{id}/blocks/bulk-review`. The backend repeats
all eligibility checks, rejects stale identities and mixed eligible/ineligible
selections atomically, and refuses published, superseded, or archived versions.
It never trusts the UI's classification.

Successful approval records `reviewed_by` and `reviewed_at`, synchronizes each
associated chunk to the draft review state, and writes one immutable audit event
with the version, revision, regeneration job, reviewer, selected block IDs,
counts by type, previous/resulting states, and the confirmation text. Chunks do
not become `approved` or searchable at review time. Publication promotes only
chunks belonging to reviewed blocks, preserving the existing RAG safety gate.

The companion `GET /api/v2/guideline-versions/{id}/review-blocks` endpoint
provides server-side filters, pagination, exact review identities, and progress
metrics for total, reviewed, pending low-risk, pending high-risk and rejected
blocks, sections with reviewed content, and empty leaf sections. If a stale
review is rejected, reload the workspace and re-check the affected blocks
against the newly generated source before trying again.

## What common notifications mean

| Notification | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Publication needs review` | One or more publication gates failed. | Open Editorial Review and follow the named blockers. |
| `The table ... requires publisher review` | The table is structurally valid but its generated clinical block is not reviewed. | Compare it with the source and select **Approve**. |
| `Block correction saved` | Structured data changed and its old approval was invalidated. | Review and approve the corrected block again. |
| `No reviewers assigned` | Nobody is coordinating the review yet. | Assign an eligible reviewer by name. |
| No reviewer candidates | No active user has the review permission. | Ask an administrator to grant the Reviewer role or equivalent permissions. |
| Regeneration is outdated | The saved Markdown revision has not produced the current structured projection. | Regenerate the current saved revision. |
| Regeneration is superseded | The job is permanently bound to an older immutable revision and stopped safely. | Select **Reload current revision**, verify the source, then create a new regeneration job. Do not retry the stale job. |
| `regeneration review is incomplete: N high-risk blocks still require approval` | The regenerated projection completed, but one or more safety-sensitive blocks are still `draft` or `rejected`. | Select **Review pending blocks**, approve each verified block, return to the Markdown editor, refresh approval status, and accept again. |

## Rework rules

- A Markdown correction requires save, regeneration, block review, regeneration
  acceptance, and publication validation again.
- A structured block correction resets that block to `draft`.
- A published version is never edited in place; create a new draft version.
- Do not approve content merely to remove a warning.
- Never infer missing doses, units, recommendations, page numbers, reviewer
  identity, or source attribution.

## Audit and operational records

The system records revision saves, checkpoints, assignments, comments,
regeneration requests, block corrections, block decisions, acceptance or
rejection, and publication. Use **Review & activity** to inspect collaboration
and audit events. Live cursors and realtime presence are not supported; refresh
or poll to see another user's changes.
